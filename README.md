# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Since you're using Vite for your React application, the deployment process on Vercel remains largely the same, but you'll want to ensure a few specific settings for Vite. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

Step 1: Import Your Project
Select Your GitHub Repository:
In your Vercel dashboard, click "New Project" and select the GitHub repository that contains your Vite application.
Step 2: Configure Project Settings
Set Up Build Settings:
Build Command: This should be set to vite build.
Output Directory: Set this to dist, which is the default output directory for Vite builds.
Step 3: Environment Variables (if applicable)
Add Environment Variables:
If your Vite application uses any environment variables (e.g., API keys), you can add them in the "Environment Variables" section during this step.
Step 4: Deploy Your Application
Deploy:
Click the "Deploy" button to start the deployment process. Vercel will build your application using the specified settings.
Step 5: Wait for the Build Process
Build Process:
Monitor the build process in Vercel. This should only take a minute or two.
Step 6: Access Your Deployed App
View Your Application:
Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a link to your live Vite application. Click on this link to see your deployed app.
Step 7: Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment:
Any future changes pushed to the main branch will trigger an automatic redeployment.
Optional: Custom Domain
Setting Up a Custom Domain:
If you want to use a custom domain, go to the "Domains" section in your project settings and follow the prompts to add your domain.
Summary
Your Vite application should now be successfully deployed on Vercel! If you run into any issues or need further assistance, just let me know!

When deploying a Vite application on Vercel, you'll typically need to specify the installation commands and build commands properly. Here's how you can set that up:

Installation Command
For a Vite application, the default installation command is usually:

npm install (if you are using npm)
yarn install (if you are using Yarn)
You generally do not need to specify this in the Vercel dashboard, as Vercel automatically runs this command to install dependencies during the deployment process.

Build Command
The build command for a Vite application should be:

vite build
Summary of What to Add
When you set up your project in Vercel, you would typically set:

Install Command: (this is usually not explicitly required)
Default: npm install or yarn install
Build Command:
vite build
Output Directory:
dist (This is where Vite outputs the built files.)
Steps to Set in Vercel
During the project setup, Vercel should automatically detect your project type (Vite) and populate these fields for you. However, you can manually confirm:
Installation Command: Leave it as default.
Build Command: Set to vite build.
Output Directory: Set to dist.
This setup ensures that Vercel correctly installs your dependencies, builds your Vite app, and deploys it successfully. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
